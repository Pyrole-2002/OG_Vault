# Binary Number
A binary number is a number expressed in the base-$2$ numeral system.
We say that a certain bit is **set** if it is $1$ and **cleared** if it is $0$.
The binary number $(a_ka_{k-1}\dots a_1a_0)_2$ represents the number:
$$(a_ka_{k-1}\dots a_1a_0)_2 = 2^ka_k+2^{k-1}a_{k-1}\cdots2^1a_1+2^0a_0$$
CPU's are very fast manipulating bits with specific operations.
```cpp
unsigned int unigned_number = 13;
assert(unsigned_number == 0b1101);

int positive_signed_number = 13; // 32-bit
assert(positive_signed_number == 0b1101);

short negative_signed_number = -13; // 16-bit
assert(negative_signed_number == 0b1111'1111'1111'0011); // Two's Complement
```
### Bitwise Operators
All these operators are instant on a CPU for fixed-length integers.
- `&` : The bitwise AND operator.
- `|` : The bitwise inclusive OR operator.
- `^` : The bitwise exclusive OR (XOR) operator.
- `~` : The bitwise complement (NOT) operator.
### Shift Operators
- `>>` : `a >> b` shifts the binary representation of $a$ by $b$ bits to the right. Represents integer division by $2^b$.
- `<<` : `a << b` shifts the binary representation of $a$ by $b$ bits to the left by appending zero's. Represents multiplication by $2^b$. Because of fixed-length integer, if we shift left too much, the bits start dropping and we will end up with $0$.
## Tricks
##### Set/Flip/Clear/Check a Bit
- `1 << x` is a number with only the $x^{\text{th}}$ bit set.
- `~(1 << x)` is a number with all the bits set except the $x^{\text{th}}$ bit.
- `n | (1 << x)` sets the $x^{\text{th}}$ bit in the number $n$.
- `n ^ (1 << x)` flips the $x^{\text{th}}$ bit in the number $n$.
- `n & ~(1 << x)` clears the $x^{\text{th}}$ bit in the number $n$.
- `(n >> x) & 1` checks if the $x^{\text{th}}$ bit is set in the number $n$
##### Check if Number Divisible by $2^k$
```cpp
bool isDivisibleByPowerOf2(int n, int k)
{
	int power_of_2 = 1 << k;
	return !(n & (power_of_2 - 1));
}
```
