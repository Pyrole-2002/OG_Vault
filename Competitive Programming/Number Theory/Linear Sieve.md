- Linear Sieve deals with finding all prime numbers in a segment $[2; n]$.
- The standard way of solving this is to use the [[Sieve of Eratosthenes]], but that has runtime $O(n\log\log n)$.
- This algorithm also calculates factorizations of all numbers in the segment $[2; n]$ as a side effect that can be helpful.
- The weakness of linear sieve is using more memory. It makes sense to use this algorithm only for numbers up to order $10^7$.
