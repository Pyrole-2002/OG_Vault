# Modular Inverse
- A modular multiplicative inverse of an integer $a$ is an integer $x$ such that $a\cdot x$ is congruent to $1$ modular some modulus $m$.
$$a\cdot x\equiv 1\mod m$$
- We can denote $x$ simply with $a^{-1}$.
- Modular inverse does not always exist. Modular inverse exists if and only if $a$ and $m$ are coprime.
