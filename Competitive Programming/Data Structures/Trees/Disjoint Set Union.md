- Disjoint Set Union is also known as DSU or Union Find.
- We are given several elements, each of which is a separate set. A DSU will have an operation to combine any two sets, and it will be able to tell in which set a specific element is.
- Thus, the basic interface of this data structure consists of three operations:
	- `make_set(v)` : creates a new set consisting of the new element $v$.
	- `union_sets(a, b)` : merges the set which contains element $a$ and the set which contains the element $b$.
	- `find_set(v)` : returns the
