- Priority Queue is a container designed such that the first element of the queue is either the greatest or the smallest of all elements in the queue, and elements are in non-increasing or non-decreasing order.
- The top element is always the greatest by default (can also change it to smallest).
- Priority Queue is built on top of the max heap and use an [[Array]] or [[Vector]] as an internal structure. It is the implementation of [[Heap]] data structure.
