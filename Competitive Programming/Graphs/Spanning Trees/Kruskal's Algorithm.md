- Given a weighted undirected [[Graphs Representation|graph]] $G$ with $V$ vertices and $E$ edges, we will find a spanning tree of this graph which connects all vertices and has the least sum of weights of all edges. A spanning tree is a set of edges such that any vertex can reach any other by exactly one simple path. The spanning tree with the least weight is called a Minimum Spanning Tree.

- Kruskal's Algorithm initially places all the nodes of the original graph isolated from each other to form a forest of single node trees and then gradually merges these trees combining at each iteration any two of all the trees with some edge of the original graph.
