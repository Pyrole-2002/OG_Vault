- Given a weighted undirected graph $G$ with $V$ vertices and $E$ edges, we will find a spanning tree of this graph which connects all vertices and has the least sum of weights of all edges. A spanning tree is a set of edges such that any vertex can reach any other by exactly one simple path. The spanning tree with the least weight is called a Minimum Spanning Tree.

- Any spanning tree consists of $V-1$ edges.
