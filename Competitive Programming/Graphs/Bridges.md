- We are given an undirected graph. A bridge is defined as an edge which, when removed, makes the graph disconnected (increases the number of [[Connected Components]]). We will find all bridges in a given graph.
- The algorithm is based on [[DFS]] and has time complexity $O(V+E)$.
- Pick an arbitrary vertex of graph `root` and run DFS from it.
- At any point in DFS, the edge from $(v, to)$ is a bridge iff none of the vertices $to$ and its descendants in the DFS has a back-edge to vertex $v$ or any of its ancestors. This means that there is no other way from $v$ to $to$ except for edge $(v, to)$.
