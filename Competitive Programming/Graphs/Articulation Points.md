- We are given an undirected graph. An articulation point (or cut vertex) is defined as a vertex which, when removed along with its edges, makes the graph disconnected (increases the number of [[Connected Components]]). We will find all articulation points in a given graph.
- The algorithm is based on [[DFS]] and has time complexity $O(V+E)$.
- Pick an arbitrary vertex of the graph `root` and run DFS from it.
- At any point in DFS, when we are at vertex `v != root`, if the current edge $(v, to)$ is such that none of its vertices $to$ or it's descendants in the DFS traversal has a back edge to any of ancestors of $v$, then $v$ is an articulation point. Otherwise, $v$ is not an articulation point.
- The case where `v == root` is an articulation point iff this vertex has more than one child in the DFS tree.
