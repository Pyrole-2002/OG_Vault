- We have a weighted [[Graphs Representation|Graph]] with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges. The weights of all edges are non-negative. We are given a starting vertex $s$. We will then find the lengths of the shortest paths from a starting vertex $s$ to all other vertices. This problem is also called single-source shortest paths problem.
- Create an array $d$ where for each vertex $v$ we store the current length of the shortest path from $s$ to $v$ in `d[v]`.
- Initially, `d[s] = 0`, and for all other vertices this length equals infinity.
$$
d[v] = \infty\quad \forall\quad v\ne s
$$
- We also maintain a boolean array $u$ which stores for each vertex $v$ whether it's marked. Initially, all vertices are unmarked.
- Dijkstra's Algorithm runs for $n$ iterations. At each iteration, a vertex $v$ is chosen as unmarked vertex which has least value of $d$.
- The selected vertex $v$ is marked, from $v$ relaxations are performed where all edges of the form $(v, to)$ are considered and for each vertex $to$, the algorithm tries to improve the value $d[to]$. If the length of the current edge is $len$, then relaxation is:
$$
d[to] = \min(d[to,\ d[v]+len])
$$
- After all the edges are considered, the current iteration ends. After $n$ iterations, all vertices will be marked, and the algorithm terminates.
- The found values of $d[v]$ are the lengths of shortest paths from $s$ to all vertices $v$.
### Restoring Shortest Paths
- If we want to know not only the lengths of the shortest paths but the paths themselves, we will maintain an array of predecessors $p$ in which for each vertex $v \ne s$, $p[v]$ is the penultimate vertex in the shortest path from $s$ to $v$.
- We use the fact that if we take the shortest path to some vertex $v$ and remove $v$ from this path, we'll get a path ending in at vertex $p[v]$, and this path will be the shortest for the vertex $p[v]$.
- For each successful relaxation, when for some selected vertex $v$, there is an improvement in the distance to some vertex $to$, we update the predecessor vertex for $to$ with the vertex $v$.
$$
p[to] = v
$$
#### Implementation
- For the simplest implementation, on each iteration vertex search requires $O(n)$ time and each relaxation can be performed in $O(1)$. Asymptotic time complexity becomes $O(V^2 + E)$.
- This complexity is optimal for dense graphs where $E\approx V^2$. However, in sparse graphs where $E$ is much smaller than maximum number of edges $V^2$, the problem can be solved in $O(n\log n+m)$. This will be discussed in future section.
```cpp
int n;
vector<vector<pair<int, int>>> adj;
vector<int> d, p;
vector<bool> visited;

void dijkstra(int s)
{
	d[s] = 0;
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
	{
		int v = -1; // vertex with min distance
		for (int j = 0; j < n; j++)
			if (!visited[j] && (v == -1 || d[j] < d[v]))
				v = j;
		if (d[v] == INF)
			break; // unreachable vertices
		visited[v] = true;
		for (auto edge : adj[v])
		{
			int to = edge.first;
			int len = edge.second;
			if (d[v] + len < d[to])
			{
				d[to] = d[v] + len;
				p[to] = v;
			}
		}
	}
}

vector<int> restorePath(int s, int t)
{
	vector<int> path;
	for (int v = t; v != s; v = p[v])
		path.push_back(v);
	path.push_back(s);
	reverse(path.begin(), path.end());
	return path;
}
```
## Dijkstra on Sparse Graphs
- In the simplest implementation, there are two operations, finding the unmarked vertex with smallest $d$ and the time of relaxation. The first operation is performed $O(V)$ times and requires $O(V)$ per operation, while the second operation is performed $O(E)$ times and requires $O(1)$ per operation making the overall complexity $O(V^2 + E)$.
- To improve the complexity for sparse graphs when $E$ is much smaller than $V^2$, we need to improve the complexity of the first operation without affecting the second significantly.
- The most efficient data structure for this is the **Fibonacci Heap** which allows the first operation to run in $O(\log V)$ and the second operation in $O(1)$. The overall complexity becomes $O(V\log V + E)$. However, they are very complex to implement and also have a large hidden constant.
- We will use data structures that perform both types of operations to give us a total time complexity of $O(n\log n + m\log n) \approx O(m\log n)$
### [[Set]] Implementation
- Since we need to store vertices ordered by their values $d$, it is convenient to store actual pairs with the distance and the index of the vertex. As a result in a set, pairs are automatically sorted by their distances.
- We no longer need the `visited[]` array because we use the set to store that information.
```cpp
int n;
vector<vector<pair<int, int>>> adj;
vector<int> d, p;

void dijkstra(int s)
{
	d[s] = 0;
	set<pair<int, int>> q;
	q.insert({0, s});
	while (!q.empty())
	{
		int v = q.begin()->second;
		q.erase(q.begin());
		for (auto edge : adj[v])
		{
			int to = edge.first;
			int len = edge.second;
			if (d[v] + len < d[to])
			{
				q.erase({d[to], to});
				d[to] = d[v] + len;
				p[to] = v;
				q.insert({d[to], to});
			}
		}
	}
}
