- We have a weighted graph with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges. The weights of all edges are non-negative. We are given a starting vertex $s$. We will then find the lengths of the shortest paths from a starting vertex $s$ to all other vertices. This problem is also called single-source shortest paths problem.
