- Given a weighted directed graph $G$ with $V$ vertices and $E$ edges, and some vertex $v$, we will find the length of shortest paths from vertex $v$ to every other vertex.
- Unlike [[Dijkstra's Algorithm]], this can also be applied to graphs containing negative weight edges. However, if the graph contains a negative cycle, then the shortest path to some vertices may not exist. This algorithms can also detect the presence of a cycle of negative weight and deduce this cycle.
- First assume that the graph contains no negative weight cycle. We create a distance array $d$ of size $V-1$, which after completion of the algorithm will contain the answer to the problem. Initialize `d[v] = 0`, and all other elements of $d$ to $\infty$.
- The algorithm consists of phases, each phase scans through all edges of the graph, and the algorithm tries to produce relaxation along each edge.
