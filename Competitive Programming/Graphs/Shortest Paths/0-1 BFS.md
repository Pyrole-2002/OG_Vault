- It is well-known that we can find the shortest paths between a single source and all other vertices in $O(E)$ using [[BFS]] in an unweighted graph.
- An unweighted graph may be interpreted as a weighted graph with all edge weights equal to $1$. If all edge weights are different, then a more general algorithm like [[Dijkstra's Algorithm]] is appropriate.
- However, if the weight of each edge is either $0$ or $1$, then we can use BFS to solve the single source shortest path problem in $O(E)$.
