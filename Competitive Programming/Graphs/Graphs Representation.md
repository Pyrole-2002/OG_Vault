- A graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes that have data and are connected to other nodes through edges.

- Nodes (vertices) are circles represented by numbers. The numbering can be done in any order, no specific order needs to be followed.
- An undirected graph is a graph where edges are bidirectional, with no direction associated with them. Pair of vertices to represent any edge is unordered.
- A directed graph is a graph where all the edges are directed from one node to another. Pair of vertices to represent an edge is ordered.
- A graph is called cyclic if we can start traversal from a node and end at the same node.
#### Degree of Graph
- It is the number of edges that go inside or outside that node.
- For undirected graphs, the degree of a node is the number of edges attached to that node.
- For directed graphs, indegree is the number of incoming edges and outdegree is the number of outgoing edges.
- Total degree of a graph is twice to number of edges.
