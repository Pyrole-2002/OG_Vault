- The dataset pertains to student achievement in secondary education and encompasses information from two Portuguese schools. It was gathered through the utilization of school reports and questionnaires, capturing a variety of attributes including student grades, demographic details, social factors, and school-related features.
- Two distinct datasets are provided, each focusing on the performance in a specific subject: Mathematics (mat) and Portuguese language (por).
- In the study conducted by Cortez and Silva in 2008, the datasets were structured to facilitate binary and five-level classification as well as regression tasks.
- An important observation highlighted in the study is the strong correlation of the target attribute, G3, with attributes G2 and G1. This correlation arises due to the fact that G3 represents the final year grade issued during the 3rd period, while G1 and G2 correspond to grades from the 1st and 2nd periods respectively. It is noted that predicting G3 without considering G2 and G1 is challenging, yet such prediction holds significant utility, as detailed in the referenced paper.
